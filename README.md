## Project Structure

```
/app
  /components
    Auth.tsx              # Simple wrapper component (no authentication)
    RecipeGenerator.tsx   # Main application logic and state management
    IngredientSelector.tsx # Modal for selecting ingredients
    ImageUploader.tsx     # Drag-and-drop image upload component
    RecipeCard.tsx        # Individual recipe display cards
    RecipeDisplay.tsx     # Full recipe details modal
  layout.tsx              # Root layout with global styles
  page.tsx                # Main entry point
  globals.css             # Global CSS with Tailwind
```

## How It Works

### Recipe Discovery Flow
1. **Start**: Click "Find a Recipe" to begin
2. **Choose Method**: 
   - Select ingredients from a predefined list, OR
   - Upload a food image for automatic ingredient detection
3. **Get Results**: See a curated list of recipes based on your selection
4. **View Details**: Click any recipe card to see full ingredients and step-by-step instructions

### Smart Mock Data
The app includes an intelligent recipe database with:
- **6 diverse recipes** covering different cuisines and difficulty levels
- **Ingredient matching algorithm** that finds recipes based on what you have
- **Realistic image analysis simulation** that suggests relevant ingredients
- **Responsive recipe filtering** that adapts to your selections

## Sample Recipes Included

- **Classic Margherita Pizza** - Italian classic with fresh ingredients
- **Grilled Cheese Sandwich** - Comfort food favorite
- **Fresh Caprese Salad** - Light and refreshing
- **Chicken Fried Rice** - Asian-inspired one-pan meal
- **Garlic Pasta** - Simple but delicious Italian
- **Classic Omelette** - Perfect breakfast option

## Customization

### Adding More Recipes
Edit the `allRecipes` array in `/app/components/RecipeGenerator.tsx`:

```typescript
const allRecipes = [
  {
    recipe_id: 7,
    name: 'Your Recipe Name',
    ingredients: ['ingredient1', 'ingredient2'],
    steps: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],
    image_url: 'https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg'
  },
  // ... more recipes
]
```

### Ingredient List
Modify the `AVAILABLE_INGREDIENTS` array in `/app/components/IngredientSelector.tsx`:

```typescript
const AVAILABLE_INGREDIENTS = [
  'Your Ingredient', 'Another Ingredient'
  // ... more ingredients
]
```

### Colors & Styling
The app uses a minimalist color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`. The primary accent color is blue (`#3B82F6`), which can be changed by modifying the `accent` color in the config.

## Future Enhancements

This app is designed to be easily extensible. Potential additions:

- **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual recipe APIs or databases
- **User Favorites**: Local storage for favorite recipes
- **Shopping Lists**: Generate ingredient shopping lists
- **Nutritional Info**: Add calorie and nutrition data
- **Social Features**: Share recipes with friends
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by cuisine, diet, cooking time, etc.

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel via GitHub or CLI
```
